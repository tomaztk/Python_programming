## **Lesson 5: Python Data Structures - Part 1**

---

### **1. Tuple Creation & Access**

Create a tuple called `fruits` with 5 fruit names. Print the first and last fruit using indexing.

---

### **2. Unpacking Tuples**

Create a tuple `(name, age, country)`. Unpack it into separate variables and print them in a formatted string: `"Name: ___, Age: ___, Country: ___"`.

---

### **3. Tuple Immutability**

Try to change the second item of a tuple. Observe and print the error message.

---

### **4. Tuple with Mixed Data Types**

Create a tuple with an integer, a float, a string, and a boolean. Print each item and its data type.

---

### **5. List Creation and Manipulation**

Create a list `numbers` with values \[10, 20, 30, 40, 50].

  * Add 60 to the end.
  * Insert 25 at position 1.
  * Remove 40 from the list.
  * Print the final list.

---

### **6. Slicing Lists and Tuples**

Given a list `nums = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`, print:

  * The first three numbers.
  * The last two numbers.

---

### **7. List Methods Practice**

Given a list of cities, practice these methods:

  * `append()`, `pop()`, `reverse()`, `sort()`
  * Print the list after each operation.

---

### **8. Converting Between Tuples and Lists**

Convert a tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4)` to a list, add `5`, then convert it back to a tuple. Print the final tuple.

---

### **9. Looping Through Tuples and Lists**

Write a function that takes a list of integers and prints only the even numbers.

---

### **10. Nested Lists**

Create a 2D list (matrix) for 3 studentsâ€™ marks in 3 subjects each. Print each student's marks in a readable format.

---

### **11. Using Lists with Input**

Ask the user to enter 5 numbers (using `input()` in a loop). Store them in a list and print the maximum and minimum value.

---

### **12. List Comprehensions**

Given a list of numbers, create a new list containing only their squares using a list comprehension.

---

### **13. Finding Duplicates in a List**

Given a list with some repeated numbers, print all numbers that appear more than once.

---

### **14. Functions Returning Tuples**

Write a function that receives two numbers and returns both their sum and product as a tuple. Call the function and print the results.

---

### **15. Combining Strings and Lists**

Given a string of comma-separated values, split it into a list. Then, sort and join the list back into a comma-separated string and print it.
