## LESSON 3: PYTHON CONTROL FLOW (Exercises)

### Hands-On Practice of Lesson 1 and Lesson 2

---

### 1. **Even or Odd?**

Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is even or odd.

---

### 2. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**

Prompt the user to enter a number. Print whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

---


### 4. **Grade Evaluator**

Ask the user to enter a test score (0-100). Print out the corresponding grade:

* 90-100: A
* 80-89: B
* 70-79: C
* 60-69: D
* Below 60: F

---

### 5. **Multiplication Table**

Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a number provided by the user, from 1 to 10.

---

### 6. **Sum of N Numbers**

Ask the user for a positive integer N. Then, use a loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to N.

---

### 7. **Countdown**

Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop, printing each number.

---

### 8. **Print All Even Numbers Between 1 and 50**

Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.

---

### 9A. **Number Guessing Game (Basic)**

Generate a secret number (e.g., 7). Ask the user to guess the number until they get it right. After each guess, give a hint whether their guess was too high or too low.

---

### 9B. **Number Guessing Game (Advanced)**

Same as 9A: Generate a secret number (e.g., 7). Ask the user to guess the number until they get it right. After each guess, give a hint whether their guess was too high or too low.

Addition: Store all user guesses. Warns if a number is guessed again (does not count repeated guesses as new tries). And calculate the success ratio at the end. Success ratio = valid unique guesses divided by total number of tries, expresses as a percentage.

E.g.:

* 1. 100% if correct in first try,
* 2. 50% if got it after 2 tries but only 1 was valid, 
* 3. 33% if got it after 3 tries 
* 4. 25% ...etc.


---

### 10. **Sum of Even Numbers in a List**

Given a list of numbers, write code to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in the list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

---

### 11. **Find the Largest Number**

Write a program that takes 5 numbers from the user (one at a time) and prints the largest one.

---

### 12. **Simple ATM Menu**

Simulate an ATM menu:

* 1. Check balance
* 2. Deposit
* 3. Withdraw
* 4. Exit

Use `if-elif-else` statements and a loop to allow the user to perform multiple actions until they choose to exit.

---

### 13. ** AbraKadabra**

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50.

* For multiples of 3, print “Abra” instead of the number.
* For multiples of 5, print “Kadabra”.
* For multiples of both 3 and 5, print “AbraKadabra”.

---

### 14. **Palindrome Checker**

Ask the user for a word. Print whether it is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards).
