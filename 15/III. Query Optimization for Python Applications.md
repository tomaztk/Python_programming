##  **III. Query Optimization for Python Applications**

Optimizing SQL queries isn't just about database performance—it's about **writing Python applications that are faster, safer, and more scalable**. This section explains **how indexes, query limits, prepared statements, and connection pooling** contribute to efficient Python+SQL workflows.

---

### **a. Indexing and Performance**

---

####  **What is an Index?**

An **index** is like a lookup table used by the database to **quickly locate rows** without scanning the entire table. Think of it as a book's table of contents.

* Without an index: the DB must **scan every row** (sequential scan).
* With an index: it **jumps directly** to matching entries (index scan).

---

####  **Creating an Index**

Example: Create an index on `user_id` in the `orders` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```

###### Why?
If you're frequently filtering orders by user in Python:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = %s", (some_user_id,))
```

…then indexing `user_id` **dramatically speeds up** the query by avoiding full table scans.

---

####  **Measuring with EXPLAIN**

Use `EXPLAIN` before your query to see how it's executed:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1;
```

 **Output:**

```
Index Scan using idx_user_id on orders  (cost=0.15..8.27 rows=1 width=32)
```

 Means it's **using the index** – much faster than a “Seq Scan”.

---

####  Python Example with Indexed Query

```python
cursor.execute("EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = %s", (1,))
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row[0])
```

 **Best Practice:** Index columns used in:

* WHERE conditions
* JOIN keys
* ORDER BY clauses


 Avoid indexing:

* Small tables
* Highly volatile columns (frequent updates)
* Columns with low selectivity (e.g. `is_active` with 99% TRUE)

---

### **a2. Other Types of indexes**


###  **Single-Column Index**

   * Index on one column (e.g., `user_id`)
   * Best for queries like:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 3;
     ```

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON orders(user_id);
   ```
---

###  **Multi-Column (Composite) Index**

   * Index on **two or more columns** used together in WHERE or JOIN clauses.
   * Example: Speed up filtering on `user_id` **and** `order_date`.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);
   ```

   Useful for queries like:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders
   WHERE user_id = 2 AND order_date > '2024-01-01';
   ```

   Order matters in composite indexes.

---

### **Unique Index**

   * Ensures values in a column are unique (like emails).
   * Often added automatically with `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE`.

   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON users(email);
   ```

   Prevents duplicate users based on email.

---

### **Partial Index**

   * Only indexes **part** of a table (rows that meet a condition).
   * Useful for optimizing **frequently queried subsets**.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_high_value_orders
   ON orders(order_total)
   WHERE order_total > 100;
   ```

   Speeds up:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_total > 100;
   ```

---

### **Covering Index**

   * Index that includes **all columns** needed by a query.
   * Avoids going back to the main table (index-only scan).

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_cover_user_orders ON orders(user_id, order_total);
   ```

  Covers:

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, order_total FROM orders WHERE user_id = 2;
   ```

---

### **Choosing the Right Index**

| Query Type                       | Index Recommendation |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Filter by one column             | Single-column index  |
| Filter by two+ columns           | Composite index      |
| Frequently queried value range   | Partial index        |
| Columns always returned together | Covering index       |
| Enforce uniqueness (e.g. email)  | Unique index         |

---

###  **Using EXPLAIN to See Index Use**

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 2;
```

Look for: `Index Scan using idx_user_id`
Avoid: `Seq Scan` unless table is very small

---


### **Reminder: Indexes Improve Reads, But…**

* **Slow down INSERTs/UPDATEs**
* **Consume disk space**
* **Need maintenance (reindexing occasionally)**

---


###  **b. Limiting Result Sets**

---

When fetching from large tables (e.g., logs, transactions), always **limit rows** to avoid memory issues.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 100 OFFSET 0;
```

 **Python Tip: Use Pagination or Generators**

```python
def get_orders_paginated(offset=0, limit=100):
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT %s OFFSET %s", (limit, offset))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

 Also consider:

* Using cursors (`fetchmany()`)
* Streaming data if using `psycopg2` with `named cursors`

---

### **c. Prepared Statements and Parameterization**

---

####  **Why Use Parameters?**

* Prevent **SQL injection**
* Improve **query plan reuse** (database caches execution plan)
* Clean separation of SQL logic and values

---

####  **Unsafe Example (Don’t do this!)**

```python
email = "bob@example.com"
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'")  # BAD
```

If `email` is `"bob@example.com' OR '1'='1"` – you’ve just been hacked.

---

####  **Safe Parameterized Version**

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s", (email,))
user = cursor.fetchone()
```

 Works similarly with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.:

```python
cursor.execute(
    "INSERT INTO payments (order_id, payment_date, amount) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
    (2, '2023-11-12', 75.00)
)
```

---

###  **d. Connection Pooling**

---

Creating new DB connections is expensive. **Pooling** allows reuse of existing connections.

####  Example with `psycopg2`:

```python
from psycopg2 import pool

connection_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
    1, 10,
    user="postgres",
    password="pass",
    host="localhost",
    database="mydb"
)

# Reuse a connection
conn = connection_pool.getconn()
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
...
connection_pool.putconn(conn)  # Return to pool
```

 **Why it matters:**

* Web apps (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) handle many requests in parallel.
* Pooling ensures connections are reused, not re-opened each time.
