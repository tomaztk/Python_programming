###  **I. Introduction to Pandas**

####  What Are Packages in Python?

In Python, **packages** are collections of modules that provide additional functionality. Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can use packages that others have written and shared.

* Think of packages as **toolboxes** ‚Äî they contain useful tools (functions, classes, methods) for specific types of tasks.
* For data manipulation and analysis, two of the most commonly used packages are **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

#####  Installing Packages

To use a package, you may need to install it first using `pip` (Python‚Äôs package installer):

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

In Jupyter notebooks or IPython, use:

```python
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
```

#####  Importing Packages

Once installed, import them at the beginning of your script or notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

>  `pd` and `np` are **aliases** commonly used by the Python community for convenience.

####  What is Pandas and Why It's Useful?

**Pandas** is a powerful, open-source Python package used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides flexible data structures that make it easy to clean, transform, explore, and visualize datasets ‚Äî particularly **tabular data** (like spreadsheets or SQL tables).

##### Why Use Pandas?

* Allows you to **load data** from CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.
* Helps perform **filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating** operations easily
* Designed for **fast and intuitive** data exploration
* Seamlessly integrates with **NumPy, Matplotlib**, and other libraries

---

####  Key Data Structures in Pandas

Pandas is built on two main data structures:

---

##### A-> Series: One-dimensional labeled array

* Like a single column of data with labels (index)
* Stores any data type: numbers, strings, booleans, etc.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

s = pd.Series(data, index=labels)
print(s)
```

**Output:**

```
a    10
b    20
c    30
d    40
dtype: int64
```

---

##### B-> DataFrame: Two-dimensional labeled data structure

* Think of it as an **Excel table** or a **SQL table**: rows and columns, with labels
* Each column is a Series
* Most common structure used in Pandas

**Example:**

```python
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['NYC', 'LA', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

**Output:**

```
     Name  Age    City
0   Alice   25     NYC
1     Bob   30      LA
2  Charlie   35  Chicago
```

---

####  How is Pandas Different from NumPy?

While **NumPy** is great for numerical arrays and mathematical operations, it is not designed for **labeled** or **heterogeneous** (mixed-type) data.

| Feature             | NumPy (ndarray)    | Pandas (DataFrame/Series)              |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Best For            | Numerical data     | Labeled, structured/tabular data       |
| Supports Labels     | ‚ùå                  | ‚úÖ Row and column labels                |
| Mixed Data Types    | ‚ùå (same type only) | ‚úÖ Different types in each column       |
| Readability         | Moderate           | High (like spreadsheets)               |
| Data Source Loading | Limited            | ‚úÖ Easy load from CSV, Excel, SQL, etc. |

> **Use Pandas when you want to:**
>
> * Handle real-world datasets
> * Work with structured (table-like) data
> * Do analysis or cleaning before feeding data into a model




### I.a Introduction to Polars (an alternative to Pandas) **

Introduction to **Polars** ‚Äì A Fast Modern Alternative to Pandas

#### What is Polars?

**Polars** is a newer Python library designed for fast, efficient, and parallelized data manipulation. It‚Äôs written in **Rust**, which makes it **significantly faster** than Pandas in many cases, especially when handling large datasets.

##### Why Use Polars?

* **Performance:** Built for speed with multi-threaded execution
* **Lazy Evaluation:** Like SQL or Spark, operations are planned and optimized before execution
* **Memory-efficient:** Uses Arrow-based columnar storage
* **Familiar Syntax:** Inspired by Pandas, but with its own approach

---

####  Installing and Importing Polars

```bash
pip install polars
```

```python
import polars as pl
```

---

#### Polars vs. Pandas

| Feature       | Pandas                      | Polars                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Language Core | Python                      | Rust                         |
| Speed         | Moderate                    | üöÄ Very Fast (multithreaded) |
| Evaluation    | Eager (immediate execution) | Lazy (deferred until needed) |
| API Design    | Broad and flexible          | Minimal and efficient        |
| Memory Usage  | Higher                      | Lower                        |
| Syntax Style  | Pythonic (object-based)     | Functional (method chaining) |

---

####  Example: Creating a DataFrame in Polars

```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35],
    "City": ["NYC", "LA", "Chicago"]
})

print(df)
```

**Output:**

```
shape: (3, 3)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Name    ‚îÇ Age ‚îÇ City     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ---     ‚îÇ --- ‚îÇ ---      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ str     ‚îÇ i64 ‚îÇ str      ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Alice   ‚îÇ  25 ‚îÇ NYC      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Bob     ‚îÇ  30 ‚îÇ LA       ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Charlie ‚îÇ  35 ‚îÇ Chicago  ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

---

#### Selecting and Filtering in Polars

```python
# Select a single column
df.select("Name")

# Filter rows
df.filter(pl.col("Age") > 28)
```

---

####  When to Use Polars

* Working with **very large datasets** where performance is a bottleneck
* When you need **parallel processing** or **lazy evaluation**
* For production environments where **speed and memory efficiency** matter

>  Note: Polars is newer, so while it's powerful, its ecosystem isn't as mature as Pandas yet. It‚Äôs ideal for power users or developers who are performance-focused.
